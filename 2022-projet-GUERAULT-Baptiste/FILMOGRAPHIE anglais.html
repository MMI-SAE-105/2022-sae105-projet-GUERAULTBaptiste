        <p>Although he loves his family, Bob is bored with the routine of his life as a middle-class suburbanite and his job as an office worker in a bland insurance company. Along with his best friend Lucius Best. One day, his supervisor stops him from intervening during a racket. Bob loses his temper and injures him, and is fired. Back home, Bob receives a message from a woman who calls herself Mirage, who gives him the mission to destroy an out-of-control tripod robot, Omnidroid 08, on the remote island of Nomanisan. Bob, more than happy to finally reactivate Mr. Indestructible, accepts the mission.</p>

The unit must then retrieve agent Ethan Hunt, then in custody in a Moscow prison for an unknown reason. The escape is successful, despite Hunt's decision to break out one of the inmates, Bogdan, who has valuable information. As soon as he is released, Hunt is given a mission: to infiltrate the Kremlin archives with agents Benjamin Dunn and Jane Carter as quickly as possible to retrieve the file of Cobalt, the terrorist who hired Moreau.</p>
