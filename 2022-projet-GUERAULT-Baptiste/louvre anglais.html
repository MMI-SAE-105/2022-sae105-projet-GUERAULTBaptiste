        <h1>The Louvre Museum</h1>
        <p>-Located in the 1st arrondissement of Paris, on the right bank between the Seine and the rue de Rivoli, the museum is distinguished by the glass pyramid of its reception hall, erected in 1989 in the courtyard of Napoleon and which has become emblematic of the museum, while the equestrian statue of Louis XIV is the starting point of the Parisian historical axis.</p>

        <p>-In 2018, with approximately 10.2 million annual visitors, the Louvre is the most visited museum in the world. It is the most visited paying cultural site in France. Among its most famous pieces are The Mona Lisa, The Venus de Milo, The Crouching Scribe, The Victory of Samothrace, and the Code of Hammurabi.</p>

        <p>-Following the departure of Louis XIV for the Palace of Versailles at the end of the 17th century, part of the royal collections of paintings and antique sculptures were stored there. After having housed several academies for a century, including that of painting and sculpture, as well as various artists housed by the king, the former royal palace was truly transformed during the Revolution into the "Central Museum of the Arts of the Republic". It opened in 1793, exhibiting approximately 660 works, mainly from royal collections or those confiscated from emigrant nobles or from churches. Thereafter, the collections were constantly enriched by war captures, acquisitions, patronage, bequests, donations, and archaeological discoveries.</p>
