        <h1>A hope</h1>
        <p>-The advantage or rather the hope is that thanks to these networks and phones they have access to good things too because there is the possibility of having good use of them to inform themselves and to increase their general culture and many other positive points. The young people of today are much more open minded as the most known example, the LGBT movement, the more the years advance the more people support this movement and others in the style, which at the base are not accepted or badly seen by the society.</p>

        <p>-Thanks to social networks many people have started to express themselves on different subjects which makes it easier for people to talk, discuss and accept the influence created by the number of videos or messages that circulate on a subject so debates take place as well as the intervention of certain influencers whose content is closest to the subject.</p>

        <p>Most young people today are open-minded and willing to discover things like cultures, mentality or passions different from their own. So the world is moving forward and changing by adapting to each person's personality and specialties. The new generation is looking to do or understand more things than before and has a thirst for experience no matter what.</p>

        <p>-People are much more likely to listen and participate and are increasingly comfortable with each other and with society and are especially eager to help and teach others what they know and pass on their knowledge to younger people. They are also more sociable, most of them have no difficulty in expressing themselves and talking to new people and getting to know them, of course this has its advantages and disadvantages. They are tired of the routine and monotonous days, their goal is to find an alternative.</p>
